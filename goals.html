    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <p>
      I am keen on expanding my understanding and gaining an in-depth knowledge
      of computer subjects and technical skills that would help me contribute
      greatly to this field. I wish to see myself as a highly skilled software
      engineer who can understand the business models and designs, architect as
      well as code them.
